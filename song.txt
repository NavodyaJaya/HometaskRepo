I'm opening my eyes in the darkness
When my heartbeat sounds unfamiliar
I'm looking at you in the mirror
The fear-ridden eyes, asking the question

Loving myself might be harder
Than loving someone else, let's admit it
The standards you made are more strict for yourself
The thick tree rings in your life
It's part of you, it's you
Now let's forgive ourselves
Our lives are long, trust yourself when in a maze
When winter passes, spring always comes

From the eyes of the cold night
I try to hide myself
As I keep tossing and turning, ayy
